Linux signal callbacks for SourceMod

Building on Windows 10 with VS2022 and CMake

This folder should be extracted where your sourcemod extension build folder is. Also make sure that you have the top-level _CMakeLists.txt_ at the same level with SourceMod SDK and other HL2 SDKS.

1. Install Windows Subsystem for Linux. Check that the installed WSL is version 2 using "wsl --list -v".
2. In the (Debian based) Linux, install CMake and the development environment including multiarch support  with "dpkg --add-architecture i386; apt update && apt upgrade" and "apt-get install build-essential cmake gcc-multilib g++-multilib"
3. Open or install Visual Studio. Include Linux support in the installer to view and browse all Linux header files on your Windows machine.
4. In Visual Studio, open the folder where the top level _CMakeLists.txt_ is located. 
5. Under Tools > CMake > General, select "Always use CMake presets", close the current folder and reopen it again. This should make the connections and configuration managers appear in the top bar. Refer to [1] if you have any problems.
6. Select "WSL: Debian" (or your flavour of Linux) and the Linux Debug configuration. Modify the _CMakePresets.json_ file to include more build configurations for your liking.

Your files should now get rsynced to the WSL system. Building happens on the WSL automatically when you choose to build on VS.
