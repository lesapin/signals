Linux signal callbacks for SourceMod

Building on Windows 10 with Visual Studio 2022 and CMake

This folder should be extracted in the same folder with your SourceMod SDK and HL2SDKs.

1. Install Windows Subsystem for Linux. Check that the installed WSL is version 2 using "wsl --list -v".

2. In the (Debian based) Linux, install CMake and the development environment including multiarch support  with "sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386; sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade" and "sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake ninja-build rsync zip gcc-multilib g++-multilib"

3. Open or install Visual Studio. You should include "Workload for Linux development with C++" in the installer to make IntelliSense aware of any Linux headers in your code.

4. In Visual Studio, open the folder where the top level _CMakeLists.txt_ is located. 

5. Under Tools > CMake > General, select "Always use CMake presets", close the current folder and reopen it again. This should make the connections and configuration managers appear in the top bar. Refer to [1] if you have any problems.

6. Select "WSL: Debian" (or your flavour of Linux) and the Linux Debug configuration. Modify the _CMakePresets.json_ file to include more build configurations for your liking.

Your files should now get rsynced to the WSL system and all builds should happen there.

If your extension isn't loading because of an outdated GLIBCXX_* version, you can follow the instructions in [2]. Renaming the stdc++ library in .../sdk2013/bin/libstdc++.so.6 will probably fix your issue.
